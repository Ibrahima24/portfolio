<h2>About Ibrahima</h2>

<p>Since graduating college I have worked in the film and television industry. I'm a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>. I have always had an interest in film and television since I was a young child. I would end up editing Wikipedia pages to add important pieces of information on select films and television shows. I look forward to starting a career as a software engineer because I gained an interest in coding. Please reach out if you're looking to hire a new developer. </p>
